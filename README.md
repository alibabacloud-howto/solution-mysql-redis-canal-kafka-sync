## 3. Scene introduction

### 3.1 Experimental scene

This document uses Kafka and [Canal](https://github.com/alibaba/canal) to achieve data synchronization between Redis and MySQL. The architecture diagram is as follows:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/G/V/B/XRb0l220tb36.png)

Through the architecture diagram, we can clearly know the components that need to be used, MySQL, Canal, Kafka, Redis, etc.

Except for Canal which needs to be deployed on ECS, these components will be created using Terraform tools.

### 3.2 How Canal works

1. Canal simulates the interactive protocol of the MySQL slave, pretending to be a MySQL slave, and sends the dump protocol to the MySQL master.

2. The MySQL master receives the dump request and starts to push the binary log to the slave (ie canal).

3. Canal parses binary log objects (originally byte streams) and sends them to storage destinations, such as MySQL, Kafka, Elastic Search, etc.

## 4. Use Terraform to create resources & setup environment

### 4.1 Install Terraform

Run the following command to update the apt installation source.(This experiment uses the Ubuntu 16.04 system)

```
apt update
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/C/J/E/LZGP3Kz5HR4s.jpg)

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/U/E/L/kTmDAg87t1YD.jpg)

Enter the following command to start the canal service.

```
bin/startup.sh
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/P/M/R/Rgp8QH7oY3fg.jpg)

Go back to the Alibaba Cloud Kafka console and view the topic information.

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/M/G/T/LHqxhqMQYCdw.jpg)

You can see that the topic on Kafka has started to have messages, indicating that Canal is synchronizing RDS log data to Kafka.

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/N/G/Q/Elo38E3pNjQf.jpg)

Back to the ECS command line,

Enter the following command to download a sample jar package, which will be responsible for synchronizing the data in Kafka to Redis.

```
cd && wget https://labex-ali-data.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/canal/canal-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/S/M/M/outrCl5ttQKq.jpg)

Enter the following command to start the synchronization process, ***Please pay attention to replace YOUR-KAFKA-ADDR, YOUR-REDIS-ADDR with the user's own Kafka and Redis connection address***

```
java -cp canal-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar canal.SyncKafkaRedis YOUR-KAFKA-ADDR topic1 group1 YOUR-REDIS-ADDR Aliyun-test
```

Such as:

```
java -cp canal-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar canal.SyncKafkaRedis 172.16.4.16:9092,172.16.4.14:9092,172.16.4.15:9092 topic1 group1 r-3nsa4cc5c3d04814.redis.rds.aliyuncs.com Aliyun-test
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/H/X/S/5adH01c2CXrf.jpg)

You can see that the data is being synchronized, and the output messages are consumed from Kafka.

The message being consumed here is that Canal synchronizes RDS binlog file data to Kafka, which is aimed at RDS
The default "mysql" database message in the example. When the sample jar package consumes these messages, it will be output directly.
 
When the message of the target database "labex" is consumed, the data in Redis will be updated.

## 6. Data synchronization test

Next, create two new ECS command line interfaces.

The one that is executing the synchronization process is called command line 1.

The newly created ones are called command line 2 and command line 3, respectively.

### 6.1 Insert data

At the command line 2.

Enter the following command to log in to the RDS database. ***Please replace YOUR-RDS-PRIVATE-ADDR with the user's own RDS intranet address***.

```
mysql -ulabex -hYOUR-RDS-PRIVATE-ADDR -pAliyun-test -D labex
```

Such as:

```
mysql -ulabex -hrm-3ns7ry11cc5qiq5nj.mysql.rds.aliyuncs.com -pAliyun-test -D labex
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/P/T/X/FB1quKVJPEjD.jpg)

Enter the following command to insert data into the user table.

```
insert into user values("19832", "name1", "ddsdfdfd", "addr1", "17138141002", "nickname1");
insert into user values("20122", "name2", "xdfdsafd", "addr2", "13877686321", "nickname2");
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/H/Q/D/Nhxr9jzQ9cso.jpg)

On the command line 1,

You can see that there are two records of data synchronization that were inserted just now.

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/M/J/K/YIipRg98kI1p.jpg)

On the command line 3,

Enter the following command to check whether there is data in redis. ***Please pay attention to replace YOUR-REDIS-ADDR with the user's own Redis address***

```
redis-cli -h YOUR-REDIS-ADDR -a Aliyun-test
```

Such as:

```
redis-cli -h r-3nsa4cc5c3d04814.redis.rds.aliyuncs.com -a Aliyun-test
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Q/F/B/Z4QvUE2kvxSe.jpg)

You can see that there are already two pieces of data.

Enter the following command, you can see that the data has been synchronized successfully.

```
get 19832

get 20122
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/C/V/A/m6lnoY701klI.jpg)

### 6.2 Update data

Next we update the data in RDS.

On the command line 2,

Enter the following command to update the data with id = "19832".

```
update user set username = "nanzhao" where id = "19832";
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/W/E/L/GdhV75am5LUt.jpg)

On the command line 3,

Enter the following command, you can see that the data has been updated.

```
get 19832
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/I/T/Bu5BqdpcXNP1.jpg)

### 6.3 Delete data

Next we delete the data in RDS.

On the command line 2,

Enter the following command to delete the data with id = "19832".

```
delete from user where id = "19832";
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/A/F/W/6lqm2ES0A5Kl.jpg)

On the command line 3,

Enter the following command, you can see that the Redis Key no longer exists, indicating that the synchronization is successful.

```
get 19832
```
